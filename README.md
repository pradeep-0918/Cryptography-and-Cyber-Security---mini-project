✅ Secure Web App with User Authentication & OTP Encryption
📌 Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates a secure web application that uses:
✅ User Authentication (Login/Registration)
✅ OTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
✅ Encrypted OTP protection using AES/RSA
✅ Secure password hashing with bcrypt
✅ JWT-based session management

The main goal is to showcase how cryptography and web security techniques are applied in real-world authentication systems.

🎯 Objectives

Implement secure user login & registration.

Generate OTPs and encrypt them before storage.

Send OTPs using Email/SMS.

Validate OTPs with time-based expiration.

Use bcrypt for password hashing and salting.

Provide JWT-based session handling.

Ensure modern UI with a user-friendly flow.

🔐 Security Features Used
Feature	Technique
Password Security	bcrypt hashing + salting
OTP Security	AES/RSA encryption
OTP Expiry	Time-limited validation
Data Transport	HTTPS (recommended)
Session Security	JWT token-based authentication
Attack Protection	Rate-limited login attempts
🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Tools/Frameworks
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React optional)
Backend	Python Flask / Node.js Express
Database	MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB
Encryption	bcrypt, AES, RSA
OTP	pyotp / random / Twilio
Session	JWT
📍 Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1️⃣ User Registers → Password is hashed & stored
2️⃣ User Logs in → Backend verifies credentials
3️⃣ OTP is generated (6-digits) → encrypted (AES/RSA) → stored with timestamp
4️⃣ OTP is sent via Email/SMS
5️⃣ User enters OTP → Backend decrypts & verifies
6️⃣ On success → Dashboard access given using JWT session

🚀 Future Enhancements

✅ Biometric Login
✅ WhatsApp-based OTP
✅ Role-based Access Control (Admin/User)
✅ Cloud Deployment with SSL
✅ Login Analytics & OTP failure logs

🏁 Conclusion

This mini-project shows how encryption, authentication, and cryptography combine to build secure and reliable web authentication systems. It’s an ideal demonstration for cryptography, web security, and cyber defense concepts.
